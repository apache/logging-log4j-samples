= Apache Log4j Samples: GraalVM native image
:log4j-version: 2.24.0-SNAPSHOT

This project shows how to generate a native image using GraalVM.

In order to use it:

. set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of a GraalVM installation,
. set the current working directory to the parent folder of this file,
. generate the artifact locally with:
+
[source,shell]
----
./mvnw -Pgraalvm -pl log4j-samples-graalvm -am \
clean verify
----
. run the application with
+
[source,shell]
----
log4j-samples-graalvm/target/log4j-samples-graalvm
----

== Reachability metadata

Log4j as many other Java libraries, relies heavily on reflection to convert the configuration file into an instance of a
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/config/Configuration.html[Configuration]
object.

The classes that are accessed through reflection are called Log4j plugins and GraalVM must be aware of their existence through the usage of reachability metadata.

See
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/plugins.html[Log4j plugins]
and
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/[GraalVM reachability metadata]
for more details.

The reachability metadata in this project was:

* generated using the
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/#tracing-agent[GraalVM tracing agent]:
+
[source,shell,subs=+attributes]

# Build application classpath
export CLASSPATH=$(\
./mvnw -q -Pgraalvm -pl log4j-samples-graalvm \
dependency:build-classpath -DincludeScope=runtime -Dmdep.outputProperty=classpath \
help:evaluate -Dexpression=classpath -DforceStdout \
)
CLASSPATH="log4j-samples-graalvm/target/log4j-samples-graalvm-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:$CLASSPATH"
# Run application using the GraalVM agent

org.apache.logging.log4j.samples.graalvm.Main
----

* the generated `reflect-config.json` file was further trimmed down manually, by removing all the Log4j plugins that are not used by this configuration.
These plugins are easy to spot, because they only have a `name` key.

== Native binary size

Using GraalVM 17.0.10 on Linux x64, the native binaries have the following size:

[CAUTION]
====
Since this is a trivial Java application, the difference between the binary size without and with Log4j is large: when Log4j is added GraalVM must compile many additional `java.base` classes.

In a typical application those classes are already required, so the difference should be smaller.

| Without Log4j
