/**
 * Supporting network code for JMS appenders.
 *
 * <p>Note that you can use JmsQueueReceiver or JmsTopicReceiver as executable main classes to receive log events over
 * JMS (sent via the appropriate JMS appender) that can be subsequently logged according to the configuration given to
 * the running process. Of course, use of these classes as standalone executables are entirely optional and can
 * be used directly in your application (e.g., through your Spring {@code beans.xml} configuration).</p>
